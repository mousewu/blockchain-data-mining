# Blockchain Data Mining

This repository lists some interesting reserach work on blockchian data mining an analysis.

## Papers

* ### Overview
  * Blockchain Data Analysis: A Review of Status, Trends and Challenges (Chinese)
    * [[paper]](http://crad.ict.ac.cn/CN/abstract/abstract3762.shtml)
    * This review begins by introducing the architecture and key techniques of blockchain technology and providing the main data types and their characteristics in blockchain with the corresponding analysis methods. Then, the current research progress in blockchain data analysis is summarized in seven research problems, which includes entity recognition, privacy disclosure risk analysis, network portrait, network visualization, market effect analysis, transaction pattern recognition, illegal behavior detection and analysis. Finaly, the directions, prospects and challenges for future research are explored based on the shortcomings of current research.
  

* ### Network Embedding
  * T-EDGE: Temporal WEighted MultiDiGraph Embedding for Ethereum Transaction Network Analysis
    * [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08038)  
    * This paper considers temporal characteristics and transfer values of Ethereum transaction network, which includes temporal & weight bias in random walk sampling.
    
* ### Graph Analysis
  * Market Manipulation of Bitcoin: Evidence from Mining the Mt. Gox Transaction Network
    * [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01941)
    * This paper conducts a systematic study to analyze the leaked Mt. Gox transaction data through graph analysis. They divide the accounts into three categories, extreme high account (EHA), extreme low account (ELA), and normal account (NMA) and  construct three subgraphs based on these accounts and their transactions, respectively. In order to reveal the relationship between market manipulation behaviors and the Bitcoin price, the graphs are reconstructed into daily graph series and reshaped into matrices. Through adopting SVD to the matrices, 10 very important base networks are identiﬁed. By inspecting the base networks, they ﬁnd that the daily variation of the abnormal base networks closely related to the Bitcoin price and many market manipulation patterns.
